Reddit Redesign for Web Design Decal

Some of the styles that we wanted to change from the original Reddit page was its spacing, margins, color scheme, post size and side bar/top bar features.  For the home, thread and search pages, we implemented a fixed side bar on the right that shows all the different topics that are originally featured on the Reddit site, giving viewers a more accessible and organized view of the categories.  Our side bar also features a search bar, Reddit logo, log in and sign up button where by hovering the pointer over the different elements, it highlights the select category in orange.  Our orange top bar also gives users the instant access to their profile, notifications and post addition, creating a clean and simple look.  Having both a side bar and a top bar makes the website look more appealing as we have also given more left and right margin space on the page to add more emphasis to the actual content of the site.  Aside from our side and top bars, our posts are also larger and clearer than the original Reddit posts.  The post itself contains the original elements of the Reddit posts such as the title, time stamp, description, and picture. By hovering over each post, the entire post pops out of the page and creates a 3D look over an opaque background.  Some of our features also include the like and dislike button which is actually the picture of the post itself which is why the picture is in a circular container.  When you click the picture once, the border will flash green which indicates that you have liked the post.  When you double click the picture, the  border will flash red which indicates that you have disliked the post. Furthermore, our comment thread page also demonstrates a cleaner look by giving each comment box more spacing and a distinctive look; the same border radius and box shadow from the home page is also applicable to the thread page
